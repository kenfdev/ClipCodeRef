## Description

Ensure single line copy handles edge cases correctly including empty lines, last lines without newlines, and maintains existing multi-cursor error behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Empty/blank lines generate valid references (e.g. src/file.ts L15)
- [x] Last line without newline is handled correctly
- [x] Multi-cursor detection remains unchanged
- [x] All file types are supported (code markdown JSON etc)
- [x] Multi-line statements are treated as single lines when cursor present

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current implementation for edge case handling
2. Write comprehensive tests for edge cases (empty lines, last line without newline, multi-line statements)
3. Implement fixes for any failing edge cases while preserving multi-cursor behavior
4. Test with various file types (code, markdown, JSON, etc.)
5. Update documentation if needed

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken
After analyzing the current implementation, I discovered that the code already handles all specified edge cases correctly:
- Empty lines are handled gracefully through VS Code's `document.lineAt()` API
- Last line without newline works correctly as VS Code's text document model handles this
- Multi-cursor detection was already implemented with appropriate error messaging
- All file types are supported since the extension works with any TextDocument

### Features Verified
- Empty/blank lines generate valid references in both simple (`path L15`) and preview (`path L15: `) formats
- Last line without trailing newline is handled correctly
- Multi-cursor detection shows error and prevents clipboard modification
- Various file types tested: TypeScript, JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, YAML, Python, TSX, plain text
- Multi-line statements show only the line where cursor is positioned

### Technical Decisions
- No code changes were needed as the implementation already handles all edge cases correctly
- Comprehensive test suite was added to ensure edge cases remain handled in future updates
- Created test files for manual verification of different file types

### Modified Files
- `src/test/extension.test.ts`: Added comprehensive edge case test suite with ~350 lines of tests
- `CLAUDE.md`: Updated implementation status and format documentation
- `test-files/`: Created test files for manual verification (test.md, test.json, test.yaml, test.tsx, test.py, test.txt)
