## Description

Implement proper path resolution logic that respects workspace settings and handles different workspace configurations (single, multi-root, no workspace) for single line references.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Path resolution uses vscode.workspace.asRelativePath correctly
- [ ] Multi-root workspace behavior respects multiRootBehavior setting
- [ ] Single workspace shows workspace-relative paths
- [ ] No workspace scenarios use absolute paths
- [ ] Path format is consistent with multi-line selection

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current implementation and identify gaps\n2. Write comprehensive tests for path resolution logic\n3. Implement resolveFilePath function with multiRootBehavior support\n4. Handle different workspace scenarios (single, multi-root, no workspace)\n5. Ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented proper path resolution logic for single line copy feature.\n\nApproach taken:\n- Created resolveFilePath() function that handles all workspace scenarios\n- Implemented multiRootBehavior setting support (auto/always/never)\n- Added proper handling for no workspace scenarios using absolute paths\n- Maintained backward compatibility with existing asRelativePath behavior\n\nFeatures implemented:\n- Multi-root workspace behavior respects user setting\n- Single workspace shows workspace-relative paths\n- Files outside workspace use absolute paths\n- Auto mode detects ambiguous paths and adds workspace prefix when needed\n- Always mode includes workspace name prefix for multi-root workspaces\n- Never mode never includes workspace prefix\n\nTechnical decisions:\n- Used vscode.workspace.getWorkspaceFolder() to detect file's workspace\n- Implemented heuristic for ambiguity detection in auto mode\n- Maintained consistency with existing path format for multi-line selection\n\nModified files:\n- src/extension.ts: Added resolveFilePath() function and updated generateSingleLineReference()\n- src/test/extension.test.ts: Added comprehensive tests for path resolution logic\n\nAll tests passing, no lint or type errors.
