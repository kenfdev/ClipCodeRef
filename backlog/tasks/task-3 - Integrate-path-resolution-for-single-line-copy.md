## Description

Implement proper path resolution logic that respects workspace settings and handles different workspace configurations (single, multi-root, no workspace) for single line references.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Path resolution uses vscode.workspace.asRelativePath correctly
- [ ] Multi-root workspace behavior respects multiRootBehavior setting
- [ ] Single workspace shows workspace-relative paths
- [ ] No workspace scenarios use absolute paths
- [ ] Path format is consistent with multi-line selection
