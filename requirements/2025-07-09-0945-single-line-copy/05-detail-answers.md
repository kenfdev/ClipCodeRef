## Q6: When a user has no selection (just cursor) and triggers the command, should we copy just that single line reference even if the line is part of a multi-line statement?
**Answer:** Yes
**Implication:** Single cursor always means single line reference, regardless of statement structure

## Q7: For single line copy in simple format, should we include the actual code content when the clipCodeRef.format is set to "preview"?
**Answer:** Yes
**Implication:** The format setting applies to both single line and multi-line operations

## Q8: When copying a single line that has no content (empty line), should we still generate a valid reference like "src/file.ts L15" even though the line is blank?
**Answer:** Yes
**Implication:** Generate valid references for all lines, including empty ones

## Q9: Should single line copy handle the case where the cursor is on the last line of a file that doesn't end with a newline differently?
**Answer:** No
**Implication:** Treat all lines uniformly, VS Code handles edge cases internally

## Q10: When implementing single line detection, should we use editor.selection.isEmpty or check if start and end positions are equal?
**Answer:** Yes
**Implication:** Use `editor.selection.isEmpty` as the standard VS Code API approach
