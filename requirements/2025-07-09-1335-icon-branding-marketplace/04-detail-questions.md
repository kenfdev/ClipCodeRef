# Detail Questions

## Q1: Should the extension icon incorporate visual elements that suggest both code/programming and AI/automation?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (combines the core functionality of code references with AI assistant targeting)

## Q2: Would you prefer a minimalist icon design that works well at small sizes, or a more detailed design that showcases multiple features?
**Default if unknown:** Minimalist (VS Code extension icons are typically viewed at small sizes in the activity bar and extensions panel)

## Q3: Should the gallery banner color scheme complement VS Code's default dark theme (#1e1e1e background)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (most developers use dark themes, and the banner should integrate well with the marketplace interface)

## Q4: Do you want the icon to include recognizable symbols like a clipboard, code brackets, or reference indicators (like "L15")?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (clear visual communication of functionality increases user recognition and adoption)

## Q5: Should we create icon variations for different contexts (marketplace, activity bar, command palette) or use a single adaptable design?
**Default if unknown:** Single adaptable design (maintains consistency and reduces complexity while meeting all VS Code display requirements)
