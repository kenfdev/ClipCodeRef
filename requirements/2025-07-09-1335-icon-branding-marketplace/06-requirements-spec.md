# Requirements Specification: Icon Plans and Branding Strategy for VS Code Marketplace

## Problem Statement

The ClipCodeRef VS Code extension is ready for marketplace publication but lacks essential visual branding elements required for professional marketplace presence. The extension needs an icon and cohesive branding strategy that communicates its unique value proposition as an AI-optimized code reference tool.

## Solution Overview

Create a comprehensive branding package including a minimalist extension icon, marketplace banner design, and visual identity guidelines that emphasize the extension's AI assistant integration and code reference functionality.

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Extension Icon Design
- **FR1.1**: Create a minimalist PNG icon (minimum 128x128px) that works at small sizes
- **FR1.2**: Incorporate visual elements suggesting both code/programming and AI/automation
- **FR1.3**: Include recognizable symbols (clipboard, code brackets, or reference indicators like "L15")
- **FR1.4**: Design must work well in both light and dark VS Code themes
- **FR1.5**: Single adaptable design for all VS Code contexts (marketplace, activity bar, command palette)

### FR2: Marketplace Banner Design
- **FR2.1**: Create gallery banner with color scheme complementing VS Code's dark theme (#1e1e1e)
- **FR2.2**: Banner should enhance marketplace page header presentation
- **FR2.3**: Design must differentiate from generic clipboard/code utilities
- **FR2.4**: Emphasize AI assistant integration aspect

### FR3: Visual Identity Guidelines
- **FR3.1**: Establish consistent color scheme across all branding materials
- **FR3.2**: Define typography and visual style for marketplace presentation
- **FR3.3**: Create brand guidelines for future marketing materials
- **FR3.4**: Ensure visual consistency between icon, banner, and documentation

## Technical Requirements

### TR1: File Specifications
- **TR1.1**: Icon file format: PNG
- **TR1.2**: Icon minimum size: 128x128 pixels
- **TR1.3**: Icon location: Include in extension package root or images/ directory
- **TR1.4**: Update package.json with icon property: `"icon": "images/icon.png"`

### TR2: Marketplace Configuration
- **TR2.1**: Add galleryBanner configuration to package.json:
  ```json
  {
    "galleryBanner": {
      "color": "#[COLOR_HEX]",
      "theme": "dark"
    }
  }
  ```
- **TR2.2**: Ensure compliance with VS Code branding guidelines (no use of VS Code logos)
- **TR2.3**: Test icon display across different VS Code theme modes

### TR3: Asset Integration
- **TR3.1**: Create images/ directory in project root if not exists
- **TR3.2**: Place icon file in accessible location for build process
- **TR3.3**: Update build scripts to include icon in packaged extension

## Implementation Hints

### Icon Design Concepts
- **Primary Element**: Combine clipboard symbol with code reference indicators
- **Secondary Elements**: Subtle AI/automation hints (circuit patterns, connected dots)
- **Typography**: Use "L15" or similar line reference notation
- **Color Palette**: Professional colors that work on both light/dark backgrounds

### Banner Design Approach
- **Color Strategy**: Use colors that complement VS Code's dark theme
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Extension name prominence with subtle feature hints
- **Differentiation**: Emphasize "AI-optimized" and "code reference" unique value props

### Brand Guidelines Structure
1. **Logo Usage**: Primary icon usage rules and restrictions
2. **Color Palette**: Primary and secondary colors with hex codes
3. **Typography**: Font choices for documentation and marketing
4. **Applications**: How to apply branding across different contexts

## Acceptance Criteria

- **AC1**: Extension icon is designed and saved as PNG file (minimum 128x128px)

- **AC3**: Icon includes recognizable symbols (clipboard, brackets, line reference)
- **AC4**: Icon works well in both light and dark VS Code themes
- **AC5**: Gallery banner design complements VS Code dark theme
- **AC6**: package.json updated with icon and galleryBanner properties
- **AC7**: Visual identity guidelines documented for future use
- **AC8**: All branding maintains consistent color scheme and visual style

- **AC10**: Brand elements differentiate ClipCodeRef from generic clipboard utilities

## Assumptions
